# Project plan

## Language evaluation

It's a little hard to get a handle on this
in terms of scope still. At the moment, I 
think a reasonable benchmark is that 
a user will be able to add simple due date, 
time, and repetition
annotations to Todo.txt that allow for a
queryable API to be constructed that 
calendars and similar apps can consume.

I will need to look at how easy it is for 
people to use the language. The more steps that
are necessary to enter events, the less likely
it is to be used. Simplicity is a large part
of the evaluation. I will try to add things 
piece by piece iteratively to ensure high
quality.

## Implementation plan

I think the majority of my time will be taken in
designing a solid intermediate representation
that allows for powerful data processing.
The actual implementation should be fairly straightforward.
There will also be a significant chunk of time spent on 
creating a demo at the end of the semester.

Nov 9:	Have a first pass of what the syntax will look like. Decide on if this is a separate DSL from Todo.txt
or an extension. 

Nov 16:	Make a second pass at the semantics.

Nov 23: Have a first iteration on the implementation.

Nov 30: Finish implementation.

Dec 7:	Have a demo.

## Teamwork plan 

None at the moment.
