I really like your project idea and the domain that you are working in (similar to mine)! 
I definitely think that you have a good start, but there are a lot of design desicions that 
you still need to make. Some of the questions that I have about your design are:
Why did you decide to choose TODO.txt as a basis for your DSL?
What are the benefits/disadvantages of having your DSL closely connected to 
TODO.txt vs. being completely separate? 
I think that you have a good balance between design and actual implementation work
in this project and it is also really cool that a big part of the design will include
working with me and Michael in order to see if we can design our projects such that 
they will be compatible or benefit from each other in some other way. One aspect
of your project that I was kindof unclear on from your project description was the 
querying feature. The space of questions that users can ask about their task lists so
it will be interesting to see how you will parse and deal with all of these 
questions and how you will finalize the decision about what to do when the program
receives a query that it cannot answer. I didn't really understand why an error 
message would not be desirable vs. the program doing an action that the user might not
want/be aware of. Overall, I really like the project and I think that it will be super
cool!

I agree with Christine, I think it's a good start but there's design
stuff I'd like to see more fleshed out. For example, how will
specifying "every other week" work in your language? It seems like the
DSL will need to be really rich to allow for the flexibility you're
looking for. I'd also like a little more information on exactly what
kind of data processing you intend to do on it.

(Sorry for the short critique, Christine covered most of what I have
to say)
